					<p>The project started with the aim of <strong>improving the experience of accessing information</strong> for young adults.</p>
					<p>Through desk research we <strong>explored the current context</strong> of news consumption through <strong>digital solutions</strong>, identifying the following dynamics:</p>
					<ul class="pallino">
			
						<li class="paragrafo">  fake news </li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> polarization</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> clickbait news</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> news bubbles</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> news overpopulation</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> lack of media literacy in the audience</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> fragmented information fruition</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> <p>multitasking fruition</p></li>
				
					</ul>
							
					
					<p>Those aspects were the basis to define <strong>interesting opportunities of work</strong> and where thus deeply explored with the users.</p>

		We conducted <strong>14 semi-structured interviews</strong> with people aged <strong>between 18 and 26</strong> years old. The objectives were multiple: to verify the <strong>perception of the problem </strong> already identified and eventually discover new ones, as well as their <strong>view of an optimal information activity</strong> and their <strong>actual habits</strong>. 	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		
		This allowed us to gain a <strong>deeper understanding of the current experience</strong>, the pain points most perceived and which is the context of use. We also identified some main clusters of users within the sample interviewed.	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Hence the problem statement: we decided to <strong>target young adults</strong> who believe it is <strong>important to be informed</strong>, but currently feel a <strong>lack of motivation</strong>. As the actual experience requires a lot of time and effort to be completed satisfactorily with the depth desired. 
 	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		Finally, this activity brought us also <strong>insights into the range of opportunities</strong> and the context on which focus, giving rise, through the design sprint process, to the big idea and the guidelines for its development.

					<p>The concept was validated through <strong>11 semi-structured interviews</strong>. The objective was to identify whether the solution actually <strong>brings added value</strong> and <strong>how to convey it</strong>. As well as gathering insights on some specific aspects.</p>
					<p>The idea was presented through a storyboard. We then compared, by asking for a numerical evaluation, the <strong>perception</strong> of the following problems <strong>in the current experience</strong> and then <strong>in the proposed one</strong>: </p>
					<ul class="pallino">
			
						<li class="paragrafo"> lack of reliability</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> presence of opinions and not facts</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> high cognitive effort required</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> <p>lack of motivation</p></li>
				
					</ul>
							
					
					<p>Finally, they were asked to <strong>describe the proposed service through a metaphor</strong>.</p>
					
					<p>There was a <strong>general improvement</strong> in the proposed solution with regard to the above-mentioned problems, with the exception of some <strong>concerns about the reliability</strong> of the system, due to unclear operation and lack of confidence in the algorithm.</p>
					
					<p>From this activity, we realised <strong>how important transparency of the system is</strong> for gaining the trust of users. Suggestions were also collected on functions considered to be of interest.</p>

		During the implementation of the prototype, a <strong>validation activity</strong> was carried out with 5 users with the aim of verifying that the <strong>functioning of the system was understood</strong> and the <strong>added value perceived</strong>. As well as obtaining feedbacks on the general usage of the app, the organisation of informations and functions proposed. 	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		
		The user was asked to navigate the app freely, as if he had just downloaded it, without proposing any task, <strong>to observe</strong> what would be a <strong>spontaneous use and perception</strong>. Afterwards some questions were asked to check what had been understood and general comments were collected.

		</p>
			
		<p>
		Different versions of some of the screens were also proposed in order to check <strong>how the system’s perceptions changed</strong> by changing the <strong>graphic choices</strong> and the <strong>arrangement of the elements</strong>; users were asked to give a score to some adjectives proposed, “reliability” and “captivating”, for the different versions on a numerical scale. 
 	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		
		In general, the <strong>functioning was understood</strong>, although there were a few improvements necessary in the <strong>explanation of the backend process</strong>. The functions present were appreciated: in particular the dictionary and the news history.
 	
		</p>
			
		<p>
		
		The <strong>graphical style preferred by the users</strong> between the proposed variants guided the final choices and was defined by them as <strong>equally appealing and reliable</strong>.
		Finally, we gathered some insights into what information about the activity of other people could be of interest, with the aim of guiding the choices in completing the activity section.

				<div class="contenitorep">
					<p>During the project madness the final validation of the project was carried out. The objective was to verify through the final prototype the <strong>understanding of the system</strong> and the <strong>perception of the proposed benefits</strong>. The activity was carried out <strong>in three phases</strong>: </p>
					<ul class="pallino">
			
						<li class="paragrafo"> A first one designed to remind users of the problems of the current experience.</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> A second phase to use the prototype created on Figma in order to collect feedbacks.</li>
						<li class="paragrafo"> <p> A third to explain and demonstrate the functioning of the backend implemented on Python.</p></li>

			<p>
		The project Madness allowed us to gain <strong>relevant insights for our projects</strong>. 
		About the prototype testing, the users evidenced some usability issues, as false affordances or information overloading, that were solved in the final prototype version.
		</p>
			
		<p>
		About the perceived benefits, <strong>it was confirmed that Newsworthy is able to transmit its strong and relevant benefits</strong>, which are exalted in the comparison with the current daily information experience of the users.
