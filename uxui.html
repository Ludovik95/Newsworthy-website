				<strong>All the news you need to know </strong>is now at your fingertips. Just open the app and scroll through the feed to access all - and only - the <strong>relevant news of the day</strong>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You'll be able to <strong>bookmark news</strong> directly from the homepage, <strong>learn about their sources</strong>, and <strong>change the view</strong> in which these contents are organized, according to your preferences and needs. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To make sure you don't miss anything, we segmented the daily news publication into <strong>3 different editions</strong>. These fixed appointments are designed to likely <strong>match your free time moments</strong>.

				<h2> An unified content with all the information you need to know </h2>
				</div>
				
				<div class="contenitorep">
				<p>
				
				No more wasting time comparing multiple sources to figure out what's really going on. The app does it for you through an artificial intelligence-based process that <strong>integrates articles from different sources</strong>. 
 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				You can spend the time saved in this way in fully understanding the <strong>meaning of certain expressions through the dictionary</strong>, delving into the <strong>evolution of the news through its history</strong>, or consulting the original article.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Accessory features will let you optimize the accessibility of the text, save the news, or even play it back in its <strong>audio version</strong>.

				<h2> A reliable and trasparent system </h2>
				</div>
				
				<div class="contenitorep">
					
				<p>
				The added value you will find is that of <strong>reliability</strong>. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To achieve this, we relies on an <strong>external certification authority</strong> made up of <strong>trained analysts</strong> and <strong>experienced journalists</strong> who systematically verify the reliability of the sources used by the algorithm to produce the unified content. <strong>Each source is marked with a score</strong>, which helps you be critical about who to trust and aware of why.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We believe there is no trust without <strong>transparency and explainability</strong>. That's why we developed subtle tricks within the app that aim to let you know <strong>what's going on behind the system at any time</strong>.

				<h2> Getting informed is a common commitment </h2>
				</div>
				
				<div class="contenitorep">
				<p>
				
				How informed do you consider yourself to be? While trying to answer this question, you will probably have found yourself relating your personal experience to that of the people around you. This is because we constantly <strong>perceive ourselves in relationship with others</strong>, feeling a sense of closeness and connection. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
				We believe all those considerations deserve a proper space within the app. That's why we provide you with a <strong>visualisation of your own and other people's information activity</strong>, thanks to whom you'll be able to compare data, <strong>find insights</strong> and be <strong>critical</strong>. 

				</p>
				
				<p>
				Are you ready to feel part of an informed community?
